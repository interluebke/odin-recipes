    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 pund sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a medium saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil.
            Add sweet potatoes and cook until tender but still a bit firm,
            about 15 minutes. Drain, then immediately immerse in cold water
            to loosen skins. Drain again; remove and discard skins. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Sift flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg together
            into a medium bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Chop sweet potatoes, transfer to another medium bowl,
            and mash. Mix in milk, melted butter, and egg.
            Gradually mix in flour mixture until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly grease a griddle and preheat over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Working in batches, drop heaping tablespoonfuls batter
            onto the hot griddle and cook until the surface
            begins to bubble, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and Cook on the
            other side until golden brown, 2 to 3 more minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
