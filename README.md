TOP Recipes Project

A very simple website using only HTML for displaying several recipes.
Displayed on the Homepage are several recipes with links to the recipes. The sites for the recipes contain the recipes itself and a link back to the homepage.

Used Git and Basic HTML, including lists, images, and relative links to create this project.
